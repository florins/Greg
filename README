Greg - Modelling IDE for Embedded Platforms
Version 0.01

Greg is a development environment for the non-programmers. It targets mostly the UI designers, ergonimists a.s.o. 
that want to fastly see how their application would look and run.
It is especially thought to target embedded devices like smart phones, tablets, car infotainment systems,
airplanes, trains. There is a plethora of devices needing user interfaces and they need them now, 
not in 2 months for a smart phone app and for sure not in 2-3 years for a car infotainment system. 

What will Greg have?

It will be a tool having a simple and easy to use diagram designer, like Visio.
It will also be an extremely easy to use HTML5 composer to draw nice screens.
And it will link these 2 together and show the user live how her application will look at run time.
And that because that is the application, no extra steps needed.
Ok, if you want extra sugar on the cake like connecting all this to a complicated data system we've never heard of
you'll have to go to a programmer, there's no magic solution for that.
But for planning and simply running your application this tool will do.
Ok, you can also get a cup of coffee while you do it, we usually do that.
